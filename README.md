# Bloc Jams AngularJS Starter

This repository serves as a starter project for Bloc's AngularJS-driven music player app. 

To get started, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository. Forking a repository makes a copy and adds it to your own GitHub account. This is an important step, because the your work will need be on your Github account and not Bloc's. 

Rename your forked repository to `bloc-jams-angularjs` in Github (available under the **Settings** tab of your repository).

Open your terminal, `cd` into your `~/bloc` directory, and clone your repository.

```bash
$ cd ~/bloc
$ git clone https://github.com/{username}/bloc-jams-angularjs.git
```

Make sure to replace `{username}` with your GitHub username.

1. Change into the directory: `$ cd bloc-jams-angularjs`.
2. Run `$ npm install` to download/install the needed dependencies
3. Start the node server: `npm start`.
4. Open a web browser, go to `http://localhost:3000`, and verify that you see the Bloc Jams landing page.

You can press `ctrl + c` at any time to stop the server. 

You'll want to keep the server running whenever you're working on your project.
